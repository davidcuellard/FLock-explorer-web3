# FLock.io Training Nodes and Validators Explorer

Welcome to the FLock Training Nodes and Validators Explorer! This project aims to provide a transparent view of the FLock ecosystem, allowing users to explore training nodes and validators with detailed metrics and performance insights. Think of it as a specialized block explorer tailored to display AI model metrics, rankings, and earnings.

## Key Features

- Node and Validator Listings: General information such as address, total stakes, user, reward amount, rewards claimed, node tasks with node stake, and two charts: Stake History and Total Rewards Claimed History. Delegators have similar information, except without the Stake History.

- Comparison and Ranking: Nodes and Validators are sorted by Rewards Claimed in descending order.

- Task Details: Task ID: 1, Name: [Name], Creator: [Creator], Is Completed: Yes/No, Start Time: [Start Time], Expected Duration: [Duration], Stake Amount: [Stake Amount].

- More Charts: Stake, Tracking Delegator Participation, and Rewards Distribution.

## Tech Stack Overview

- Frontend: React, with data visualization libraries like Recharts

- Backend: Node.js, Express, connecting directly to the blockchain using ethers.js

- Blockchain Integration: Direct interaction with contracts on the Base Sepolia chain (FML, Task Manager, Staking).

To get started, youâ€™ll find the backend and frontend folders each with its own `README` file to help guide setup and development.

## How to Run

- Create `.env` with
